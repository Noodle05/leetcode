     * Use Morris Travel to in order travel a binary tree.
     * </p>
     * </p>Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack
     * and recursion. The idea of Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary
     * Tree. In this traversal, we first create links to Inorder successor and
     * print the data using these links, and finally revert the changes to
     * restore original tree.</p>
     * 
     * <pre>
     * 1. Initialize current as root
     * 2. While current is not NULL
     *    If current does not have left child
     *       a) Print currentâ€™s data
     *       b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
     *    Else
     *       a) Make current as right child of the rightmost node in current's left subtree
     *       b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Although the tree is modified through the traversal, it is reverted back
     * to its original shape after the completion. Unlike Stack based traversal,
     * no extra space is required for this traversal
